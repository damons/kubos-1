Contributing to KubOS
---

KubOS welcomes everyone interested in contributing, not just with code and data, but with diversity of vision, insight, and courageous conversations.  

Our [wiki](https://docs.kubos.com/1.14.0/dev-docs/contribution-process.html) describes our development process for contributing code and documentation contained in our repositories.  Before a pull request is merged, you must [sign our Contributor's License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/kubostech/KubOS)

We've switched away from Trello to use [github issues](https://github.com/kubos/kubos/issues).  That's the best place to find or create discussions about ongoing development efforts.
